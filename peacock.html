       <h1>White Peacock</h1>
       <p class="text">Peafowl are forest birds that nest on the ground, but roost in trees. They are terrestrial feeders. All species of peafowl are believed to be polygamous. In common with other members of the Galliformes, the males possess metatarsal spurs or "thorns" on their legs used during intraspecific territorial fights with some other members of their kind.
        In courtship, vocalisation stands to be a primary way for peacocks to attract peahens. Some studies suggest that the intricacy of the "song" produced by displaying peacocks proved to be impressive to peafowl. Singing in peacocks usually occurs just before, just after, or sometimes during copulation.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="text">Now that that's out of the way, why is the white peacock without color? Some would be quick to guess that they're albino, but that's not the case. White peafowl have a genetic mutation called leucism. This causes the inability of pigment to be deposited into their feathers which results in a white appearance.</p>

       <br>
       <p>White Peacocks could be found in the wild, but many (regular) peacocks are held captive and bread to make white peacocks.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="text">
        Leucism is a wide variety of conditions that result in the partial loss of pigmentation in an animalâ€”causing white, pale, or patchy coloration of the skin, hair, feathers, scales, or cuticles, but not the eyes. It is occasionally spelled leukism.
